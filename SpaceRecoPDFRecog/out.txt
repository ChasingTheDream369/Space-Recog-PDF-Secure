IN the days when everybody started
fair, Best Beloved, the Leopard lived
in a place called the High Veldt.
’Member it wasn’t the Low Veldt,
or the Bush Veldt, or the Sour
Veldt, but the ’sclusively bare, hot,
shiny High Veldt, where there was sand
and sandy-coloured rock and ’sclusively
tufts of sandy-yellowish grass. The
Giraffe and the Zebra and the Eland
and the Koodoo and the Hartebeest
lived there; and they were ’sclusively
sandy-yellow-brownish all over; but
the Leopard, he was the ’sclusivest
sandiest-yellowish-brownest of them alla
greyish-yellowish catty-shaped kind of
beast, and he matched the ’sclusively
yellowish-greyish-brownish colour of the
High Veldt to one hair. This was very
bad for the Giraffe and the Zebra and
the rest of them; for he would lie down by
a ’sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish
stone or clump of grass, and when
the Giraffe or the Zebra or the Eland
or the Koodoo or the Bush-Buck or
the Bonte-Buck came by he would surprise
them out of their jumpsome lives. He
would indeed! And, also, there was
an Ethiopian with bows and arrows (a
’sclusively greyish-brownish-yellowish man
he was then), who lived on the High Veldt
with the Leopard; and the two used to hunt
togetherthe Ethiopian with his bows and
arrows, and the Leopard ’sclusively with
his teeth and clawstill the Giraffe and
the Eland and the Koodoo and the Quagga
and all the rest of them didn’t know which
way to jump, Best Beloved. They didn’t
indeed!
